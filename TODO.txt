- Fix the tree stump only appearing once

- When no items are equipped, left mouse click should pickup item at the floor

- Implement stackable inventory items with a number in the inventory slot corner

- When having an Axe equipped and then dragging it from hotbar to inventory slot - the Axe should disappear from the hand (i.e. not be displayed as equipped and be visible at the right side of the screen)
